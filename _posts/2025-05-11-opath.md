## üîç Introduction

Imagine you're building a secure file upload and validation system for a
continuous integration (CI) platform. After a user pushes a repository or
artifact archive, your backend unpacks it into a temporary directory. Before
any build or test can begin, you need to **verify** the contents to prevent
abuse:

- Ensure all files are confined to the extracted directory (no path traversal
tricks like `../../etc/passwd`).
- Check metadata for auditing (e.g., file ownership, timestamps).
- Reject symlinks or hardlinks that point outside the extraction root (e.g., to
`/dev/null`, or `/home`).
- Prevent tampering between inspection and usage (i.e., close TOCTOU holes).
- Detect and block references to disallowed paths like `/proc`, `/sys`, or
`/dev`.

At first glance, this might seem doable with familiar system calls like
`stat()`, `lstat()`, or `realpath()`. But these functions operate on **entire
path strings**, and once resolution is complete, it's too late to detect
whether any part of the path traversed symlinks or escaped a restricted root.
Worse, they‚Äôre prone to **time-of-check vs. time-of-use (TOCTOU)** attacks ‚Äî
where a malicious user can replace or modify a symlink between inspection and
use.

This is where `O_PATH`, combined with `openat2()` or the older `*at()` family,
shines.

With `O_PATH`, you can open a file *just to refer to its path*, without gaining
permission to read or write it. Combined with `openat2()`‚Äôs strict resolution
flags like `RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS` and `RESOLVE_BENEATH`, you can securely walk
the directory tree **one component at a time** ‚Äî validating structure, checking
metadata, and enforcing sandbox boundaries, all without opening file contents.

This approach is used in production by tools like `runc`, `systemd`, and
container runtimes to safely traverse filesystems in privilege-separated
environments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Naive Approach: Vulnerable File Walker in C

Let's say we want to recursively scan a user-uploaded directory, checking each
file's stat() info and rejecting any symlinks.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void scan_dir(const char *path) {
    DIR *dir = opendir(path);
    if (!dir) {
        perror("opendir");
        return;
    }

    struct dirent *entry;
    char fullpath[4096];

    while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
        // Skip "." and ".."
        if (strcmp(entry->d_name, ".") == 0 || strcmp(entry->d_name, "..") == 0)
            continue;

        snprintf(fullpath, sizeof(fullpath), "%s/%s", path, entry->d_name);

        struct stat st;
        if (lstat(fullpath, &st) == -1) {
            perror("lstat");
            continue;
        }

        // Check for symlinks
        if (S_ISLNK(st.st_mode)) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Rejected symlink: %s\n", fullpath);
            continue;
        }

        // Recursively scan directories
        if (S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) {
            scan_dir(fullpath);
        } else {
            printf("Accepted: %s\n", fullpath);
        }
    }

    closedir(dir);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <path>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    scan_dir(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

This looks like it checks for symlinks and avoids them. But it‚Äôs vulnerable.

---

### üîì Exploiting the Race Condition

Suppose your program is scanning /tmp/ci-job/uploads/abc/, and a malicious user
includes a directory structure like this:

```
evil/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ legit/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ legit -> /etc
```

Here‚Äôs how the attack works:

* The user uploads `evil/legit/` as a normal directory.
* Right after `scan_dir()` opens `evil/legit`, the attacker swaps it out (via a background thread or rapid timing) with a symlink:

```bash
rm -rf evil/legit && ln -s /etc evil/legit
```

* When `scan_dir()` reaches into `evil/legit/`, `lstat()` sees the *original*
directory ‚Äî but when it calls `opendir()` and walks it, it's now actually
walking `/etc`.

The result: the scanner accepts and prints arbitrary paths inside `/etc`.

This is a textbook **TOCTOU** (time-of-check vs. time-of-use) vulnerability.

---

## ‚úÖ Secure File Walker with `openat2()` and `O_PATH`

This example:

* Walks a directory tree starting from a trusted base fd.
* Uses `openat2()` with `RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS`.
* Avoids ever working with full path strings.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

This requires:
* Linux ‚â• 5.6 (for `openat2()`)
* A libc that exposes `openat2()` or use raw syscall

For portability, we‚Äôll use raw syscall here.

---

### üìÑ Code

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <linux/openat2.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int openat2_wrapper(int dirfd, const char *pathname, struct open_how *how, size_t size) {
    return syscall(SYS_openat2, dirfd, pathname, how, size);
}

void scan_dir(int dirfd, const char *rel_path) {
    int newfd;

    // Set up secure openat2() parameters
    struct open_how how = {
        .flags = O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW,
        .resolve = RESOLVE_BENEATH | RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS
    };

    newfd = openat2_wrapper(dirfd, rel_path, &how, sizeof(how));
    if (newfd == -1) {
        perror("openat2");
        return;
    }

    // Re-open for listing
    int dfd = openat(newfd, ".", O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY | O_CLOEXEC);
    if (dfd == -1) {
        perror("open directory");
        close(newfd);
        return;
    }

    DIR *dir = fdopendir(dfd);
    if (!dir) {
        perror("fdopendir");
        close(dfd);
        close(newfd);
        return;
    }

    struct dirent *entry;
    while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
        if (strcmp(entry->d_name, ".") == 0 || strcmp(entry->d_name, "..") == 0)
            continue;

        printf("Found: %s/%s\n", rel_path, entry->d_name);

        // Recurse into subdirectories
        if (entry->d_type == DT_DIR) {
            char sub_path[PATH_MAX];
            if (snprintf(sub_path, sizeof(sub_path), "%s/%s", rel_path, entry->d_name) >= sizeof(sub_path)) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Path too long: %s/%s\n", rel_path, entry->d_name);
                continue;
            }
            scan_dir(newfd, sub_path);
        }
    }

    closedir(dir);
    close(newfd);
}
```

### üß™ Example Usage

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <base-path>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    int basefd = open(argv[1], O_PATH | O_DIRECTORY);
    if (basefd == -1) {
        perror("open base dir");
        return 1;
    }

    scan_dir(basefd, ".");
    close(basefd);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üîê What This Protects Against

* ‚úÖ Escaping the base directory (../../etc) ‚Üí blocked by RESOLVE_BENEATH
* ‚úÖ Symlink tricks ‚Üí blocked by RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS
* ‚úÖ Race conditions (TOCTOU) ‚Üí avoided by resolving each component via fd

---

## üß† Understanding `O_PATH` File Descriptors

`O_PATH` lets you open a file **only for path resolution**, not access. It‚Äôs like saying: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to read or write, I just want a reference.‚Äù

### ‚úÖ What You Can Do with an `O_PATH` fd:

* `fstat()`, `fstatat()`
* `openat()` (for children)
* `readlinkat()`
* `renameat()`
* Inspect via `/proc/self/fd/`

### ‚ùå What You Cannot Do:

* `read()`, `write()`, `mmap()` ‚Üí return `EBADF`
* `execveat()` ‚Üí not supported

### Example:

```c
int fd = open("/etc/passwd", O_PATH);
read(fd, buf, 100);  // EBADF
```

But you can:

```bash
readlink /proc/self/fd/3  # shows the real path
```

## üèóÔ∏è `O_PATH` in the Real World: Tools That Rely on It

The `O_PATH` file descriptor may feel esoteric, but it plays a critical role in
modern Linux software ‚Äî especially in areas like container runtimes, service
managers, and sandboxing. Here are some concrete examples:

---

### üê≥ `runc` and Container Runtimes

[`runc`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc), the reference implementation
of the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/), uses
`O_PATH` heavily when setting up container mount namespaces. Why?

- It uses `O_PATH` to **safely traverse and bind-mount host files and
directories** into the container's rootfs.
- By opening components with `O_PATH` and resolving paths only relative to
trusted descriptors, `runc` ensures that container path traversal cannot escape
sandbox boundaries or follow unexpected symlinks.
- This guards against malicious symlink or race-based filesystem exploits
during container setup.

Relevant code in
[`libcontainer`](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/v1.3.0/libcontainer/utils/utils_unix.go#L183)
that uses `O_PATH`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è `systemd`: Secure Unit File Handling

`systemd` uses `O_PATH` in several contexts, particularly when:

- **Tracking units** that reference files which may not need to be opened or
read, but must be monitored.
- **Walking paths** in restricted mount namespaces, where certain files should
not be opened in the traditional sense.
- **Mount propagation and `PrivateMounts`** options in unit files benefit from
resolving mount targets safely via `O_PATH`.

It allows `systemd` to manage filesystem objects without exposing unnecessary
capabilities.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è `bubblewrap`: Sandboxing for Flatpak and More

[`bubblewrap`](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap), a minimalistic
userspace sandboxing tool (used by Flatpak), leverages `O_PATH` to:

- Securely resolve and isolate mount points.
- Prevent symlink tricks during sandbox environment construction.
- Traverse and manipulate filesystem state without touching file contents.

This is critical for sandboxing untrusted applications and ensuring that even
during setup, they can‚Äôt influence host filesystem state.

---

### üîé Why All These Tools Use `O_PATH`

- They operate in **security-sensitive environments** (e.g., containers,
service boundaries).
- They manipulate **filesystem state without requiring I/O** access.
- They must **walk user-controlled paths safely** ‚Äî a classic source of bugs.
- They want to **minimize privilege** while retaining full control over *where*
operations happen.

---

## üìû Conclusion

`O_PATH` gives you a **capability-style** reference to a file path ‚Äî without
opening the file. With `openat2()` and flags like `RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS`, you
get precise, secure path traversal:

* No symlink tricks
* No path escapes
* No race conditions

It's how modern container runtimes and sandboxing tools handle filesystem
traversal securely.

**If you care about safe path handling in untrusted environments, you should
care about `O_PATH`.**
