## Professional Summary

I'm Guillaume, a software engineer with 16 years of experience building and
scaling high-performance systems- primarily in the financial industry. I've
worked across the full stack, from low-latency infrastructure and in-house
databases to risk analytics platforms and container orchestration at massive
scale.

At JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, I contributed to core systems like Athena and
SecDB, supported front office trading desks, and led projects serving billions
of requests per day. I’ve designed software used by some of the world’s largest
banks, shut down legacy systems to save millions annually, and helped modernize
infrastructure across critical platforms.

I enjoy solving complex engineering challenges, especially those involving
performance, scale, and architecture. I’ve worked in both large global teams
and startup-style environments, led development efforts, and collaborated
directly with traders, product managers, and client teams.

Key strengths:
* Distributed systems and platform engineering
* Low-latency C++, Python, Go, and Java development
* Technical leadership and cross-team collaboration
* Deep understanding of the finance domain and trading desk workflows

I'm driven by solving complex technical problems and delivering robust,
scalable systems that make a meaningful impact on the business.

## Patents

### Systems and Methods for Manipulation of Private Information on Untrusted Environments

*US11641274B2 · Issued May 2, 2023*

Inventor of a system that enables the secure processing of sensitive data on
untrusted or third-party infrastructure. The design allows organizations to
perform analytics on confidential information—such as personally identifiable
information (PII), material non-public information (MNPI), or medical
records—without exposing the raw data. This patented approach helps preserve
data confidentiality while leveraging external compute resources, bridging the
gap between privacy and performance/cost in regulated environments.
